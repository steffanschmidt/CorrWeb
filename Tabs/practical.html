                    One of the core principals of <a href="nanoscience.html">Nanoscience</a> is interdisciplinarity. For me personally it goes beyond academic topics.
                    I enjoy being able to create things on my own and having the ability to design practical applications for a range of purposes ranging from simple practical things
                    for ones home to scientific equipment. However mainly the latter. This is especially true for testing purposes and prototype to product development. Therefore following
                    my bachelors degree (2015) I took a one week course in CAD and machining at Aarhus University. This gave me the tools to both design and machine stuff on my own.
                    It was also then I first came across 3D printing. Ever since then I have expanded upon this, and I finished a month at the machining workshop at
                    at the department of chemistry, Aarhus University, in March (2019). My main competencies in this field are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>CAD (Autodesk Inventor).</li>
                        <li>Machining - Milling and Turning.</li>
                        <li>3D Printing.</li>
                        <li>CNC Machining (Roland MDX40-A).</li>
                        <li>Microcontrollers and Electronic Circuit Design incl. IoT.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Furthermore I also got some knowledge about the following topics during the internship:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Inventor HSM (CAM).</li>
                        <li>Stress Analysis and Simulation in Autodesk Inventor.</li>
                        <li>EAGLE - for Electronic Circuit design.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Some of this will be presented below.

                    As can be seen from above I have been using CAD (Autodesk Inventor) for the better part of four years. Usually this has been singular component or small setups comprising of a few.
                    During my masters I designed simple containers for a variety of purposes, research equipment (Cryo DAC Cell and small Autoclave Wells for sol-gel synthesis) and molding forms
                    for ceramic components for <a href="chemistry.html#highPressure">High Pressure Synthesis</a> and some more minor projects related to it. The molding form for an octahedron can be
                    seen in the figure.
                    However during my time at the workshop I got to work more with assemblies, constraints and joints. This was partly due to a bigger focus on learning the steps from design to
                    production in greater detail, but mostly out of necessity due to the size and complexity of my main project, namely a large scale corrosion setup as can be seen under
                    <a href="practical.html#machining">Manufacturing</a>. In other words I have a broad experience with CAD and design of components, but admittedly Autodesk Inventor still has
                    a lot for me to explore.

                    <p>
                        I have been using 3D printing for the better part of four years on an on/off basis because, I did not have one myself, and I could only do it at Aarhus University.
                        However since I got my own 3D printer, I have made significant progress in understand how to achieve a great end results. The main reason I have used 3D printing a lot is
                        that it is easy to use, cheap and quick to use for making prototypes. It allows for flexible designs and some of the features that is possible to print is not possible
                        or very hard to recreate by machining in one go and vice versa. Even though it is slow for production purposes, then it is great for development or just components small
                        components that are hard to make otherwise and does not need a lot of strength. I have mainly printed with PLA, but also used ABS a couple of times.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Due to the fact I have been using 3D printing for quite some time, despite it being on/off for a long time, I made quite of a lot of different things.
                        This in turns allows me to know the limits of what is possible to print and what is not possible. This obviously depends on the printer in question and a very well
                        optimized printer may push that limit a bit further. In any case my main project with regards to 3D printing has been making small scale corrosion setups that I
                        could use for my experiments to control factors such as height of test object with respect to the water level, aeration and distance between the two metals under
                        galvanic corrosion. However due to their size they did not allow for freedom with regards to the geometric shape or heating. This is what the test setup below attempts
                        to rectify.

                            Small corrosion setup mainly made by 3D printing for corrosion testing purposes. It features a main axes where the test object is to be placed and a window for observing it.
                        </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        The setup can accommodate different geometric shapes due to the flexible design. Furthermore there are four small and large slots, where two of the latter are reserved for the main axes.
                        These can be opened and closed freely and are intended for aeration, wires, additional materials etc. The sample holders can be moved up and down by using the screws seen in the red and blue holder.
                        There are two small holes at each of the four large slots for possibility of expansion in order to add features and/or equipment for experimental or practical reason.
                        The entire setup was designed to be placed on top of a crystallization bowl as shown and that on top of a magnetic stirrer for heating purposes. I will build the magnetic stirrer myself,
                        since it will be much easier to integrate data collection, feedback loops for temperature control and estimating the corrosion current and much more. Furthermore it will also enable me to
                        implement IoT for real-time monitoring and control. Due to a semi-closed environment, it is possible to simulate marine conditions and how it affects corrosion both in water and air.
                        Lastly there is a window for observation from the top, and since the sample object is in a crystallization bowl, it makes it possible to observe the progress with ones own eye throughout
                        the entire duration of the experiment.

                        The possibility for me to be able to manufacture things and make my test setups through other means other than 3D printing has been of integral important to me.
                        Even though machining is not an academic discipline by itself, then I personally quite enjoy milling or turning in order to achieve a nice surface finish and
                        make a great product in the end. In other words I am not afraid of leaving my computer and helps out with practical issues in case that should arise. Furthermore
                        I have used a broad range of machines, which makes it easy for me to visualize and know what can be done and what cannot be done. It should be noted that even though
                        modern machines such as CNC was available to me, then I made most of my large scale corrosion setup as seen below by hand. The only part that was not made by hand was
                        the polycarbonate top plate in order to minimize damage (it turns opaque) and to achieve a better finish. Since this part of critical importance due to visibility,
                        it was milled in a large CNC (not the one shown here). This setup and its features will be discussed below.

                    As seen above I have been working on designing corrosion setups and making these with 3D print. Most of these have been small scale "kitchen experiments" with the electronics setup,
                    which you can see in the next section. However these are limited both by space both test object wise and the amount of controls I can place on them. This is partly due to the fact
                    that I myself have limited space in my apartment and partly due to a natural evolution of my knowledge in this field. Therefore I have been working on making a large setup that can
                    be seen on the image. This is basically just a box right now, since I am waiting for my electronics to arrive. However the entire idea is creating an inert environment corrosion wise,
                    where I can control a bunch of different parameters for testing corrosion on materials with real-time monitoring. Therefore most of it is made of compact laminate and POM. It consist of
                    a stage (a frame) with spindles in corner for moving the test object up and down. There are two spindles for rotating the test object in the stage plane. All of the spindles are made of
                    POM. This stage will also hold probes for measuring corrosion potentials and estimate currents and other addons (eg. conductivity, water temperature etc.). 
                    The bottom of the setup contains two aluminium plates, which will have heater cartridges for heating the water in the setup with thermocouple control. The lid of the box is made of 
                    polycarbonate, which makes it possible to observe the experiment at all times. The lid also has three slots, where it is possible to attach extra equipment (eg. a camera for recording).
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the sides of the setup all the instrumentation and controls will be places. The movement will be controlled by step motors with two motors on stage for up/down movement and one
                    for both of the axes in the stage plane. The setup will have 12V, 5V and 3.3V available for different purposes. Data collection and storage will be done through the microcontroller
                    (Teensy 3.5). Overall the setup will be capable of the following:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Real-time monitoring of galvanic potential / voltage and current.</li>
                        <li>Possibity to accelerate or stop corrosion.</li>
                        <li>Temperature control in air and water.</li>
                        <li>Air humidity.</li>
                        <li>Rotation of the test object in both of the stage axes.</li>
                        <li>Storage of data on SD card and Cloud.</li>
                        <li>A display showing information and control.</li>
                        <li>Chemically inert and closed environment.</li>
                        <li>Transparent lid for observations and recording of the entire corrosion process.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Other things that can/will be added in time:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Conductivity.</li>
                        <li>pH.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Note that this list is not exhaustive and one of the main features of a microcontroller is the ease of expansion, hence I can add things over time as I learn, or if I get suggestions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a final note apart from the monitoring then I intend to place a camera on the lid for recording and using image processing to be able to correlate the numbers to the observed effects.
                    This on its own allows for making an empirical model for simulating corrosion based. However in combination with theory it might be possible to make a generalization in order to simulate
                    corrosion based on user inputs and determine lifetimes. At least that is the end goal.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I started working with microcontrollers and electronics due to my interest in corrosion from my work at Terma as described in <a href="theoretical.html#theoryTerma">Materials Science</a>
                    Further development of the model required a compact experimental setup, which was able to measure the galvanic voltage difference or potentials precisely and log these over long spans of time.
                    However since I only had a very basic setup back then and it was not available to me after Terma, I begun making my own to. For this reason I chose to start learning how to work with and
                    program a microctronller, more specifically a Teensy, which is a computational powerful Arduino. Read more about the programming of these in <a href="programming.html#microcontrollers">
                    Programming</a>. Aside from being able to program these I had to learn how to make electronic circuits. Therefore I used my contacts at Aarhus University and read stuff/watched videos
                    on the internet to get started. I have learned a lot since then, but I am by no means an expert on it. I have worked quite a bit with amplification, motor control and data logging circuits 
                    for my corrosion setups. This includes a lot of different basic components, but two worth mentioning are op-amps and in-amps.

                    Lastly since I am developing a large setup, I will be working a lot more with internet of things, solid state relays, LCD displays, temperature control, feedback loops, (step) motor control, 
                    probe design and much more.
