                <p>
                    One of the core principals of <a href="nanoscience.html">Nanoscience</a> is interdisciplinarity. For me personally it goes beyond academic topics.
                    I enjoy being able to create things on my own and having the ability to design practical applications for a range of purposes ranging from simple practical things
                    for ones home to scientific equipment. However mainly the latter. This is especially true for testing purposes and prototype to product development. Therefore following
                    my bachelors degree (2015) I took a one week course in CAD and machining at Aarhus University. This gave me the tools to both design and machine stuff on my own.
                    It was also then I first came across 3D printing. Even since then I have expanded upon this and lately (February 2019), I just finished a month at the machining workshop at
                    at the department of chemistry, Aarhus University. My main competencies in this field are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>CAD (Autodesk Inventor).</li>
                        <li>Machining - Milling and Turning.</li>
                        <li>3D Printing.</li>
                        <li>CNC Machining (Roland MDX40-A).</li>
                        <li>Microcontrollers and Electronic Circuit Design incl. IoT.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Furthermore I also got some knowledge about the following topics during the internship:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Inventor HSM (CAM).</li>
                        <li>Stress Analysis and Simulation in Autodesk Inventor.</li>
                        <li>EAGLE - for Electronic Circuit design.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Some of this will be presented below.

                <p>
                    As can be seen from above I have been using CAD (Autodesk Inventor) for the better part of four years. Usually this has been singular component or small setups comprising of a few.
                    During my masters I designed simple containers for a variety of purposes, research equipment (Cryo DAC Cell and small Autoclave Wells for sol-gel synthesis) and molding forms 
                    for ceramic components for <a href="chemistry.html#highPressure">High Pressure Synthesis</a> and some more minor projects related to it. The molding form for an octahedron can be
                    seen in the figure.
                    However during my time at the workshop I got to work more with assemblies, constraints and joints. This was partly due to a bigger focus on learning the steps from design to
                    production in greater detail, but mostly out of necessity due to the size and complexity of my main project, namely a large scale corrosion setup as can be seen under 
                    <a href="practical.html#machining">Manufacturing</a>. In other words I have a broad experience with CAD and design of components, but admittedly Autodesk Inventor still has
                    a lot for me to explore.

                <p>
                    I have been using 3D printing for the better part of four years on an on/off basis because, I did not have one myself, and I could only do it at Aarhus University.
                    However since I got my own 3D printer, I have made significant progress in understand how to achieve a great end results. The main reason I have used 3D printing a lot is
                    that it is easy to use, cheap and quick to use for making prototypes. It allows for flexible designs and some of the features that is possible to print is not possible
                    or very hard to recreate by machining in one go and vice versa. Even though it is slow for production purposes, then it is great for development or just components small
                    components that are hard to make otherwise and does not need a lot of strength. I have mainly printed with PLA, but also used ABS a couple of times.
                </p>

                <div class="subtitle"><p>Experimental 3D Printed Corrosion Setup (Left Image)</p></div>
                <p>
                    The setup can accommodate different geometric shapes due to the flexible design. Furthermore there are four small and large slots, where two of the latter are reserved for the main axes.
                    These can be opened and closed freely and are intended for aeration, wires, additional materials etc. The sample holders can be moved up and down by using the screws seen in the red and blue holder.
                    Last there are two small holes at each of the four large slots for possibility of expansion in order to add features and/or equipment for experimental or practical reason.
                    The entire setup was designed to be placed on top of a crystallization bowl as shown and that on top of a magnetic stirrer for heating purposes.
                    Therefore due to a semi-closed environment, it is possible to simulate marine conditions and how it affects corrosion both in water and air.
                    Lastly there is a window for observation from the top, and since the sample object is in a crystallization bowl, it makes it possible to observe the progress with ones own eye throughout
                    the entire duration of the experiment.

                    The possible for me to be able to manufacture things and make my test setups through other means other than 3D printing has been of integral important to me.
                    Even though machining is not an academic discipline by itself, then I personally quite enjoy milling or turning in order to achieve a nice surface finish and 
                    make a great product in the end. In other words I am not afraid of leaving my computer and helps out with practical issues in case that should arise. Furthermore
                    I have used a broad range of machines, which makes it easy for me to visualize and know what can be done and what cannot be done. It should be noted that even though
                    modern machines such as CNC was available to me, then I made most of my large scale corrosion setup as seen below by hand. The only part that was not made by hand was
                    the polycarbonate top plate in order to minimize damage (it turns opaque) and to achieve a better finish. Since this part of critical importance due to visibility,
                    it was milled in a large CNC (not the one shown here).

                <p>I started working with microcontrollers and electronics due to my interest in corrosion from my work at Terma as described in <a href="theoretical.html#theoryTerma">Theoretical Knowledge</a></p>
                <p>Further development of the model required a compact experimental setup, which was able to measure the galvanic voltage difference or potentials precisely and log these over long spans of time.</p>
                <p>
                    For this reason I chose to start learning how to work with and program a Teensy, which is a computational powerful Arduino.
