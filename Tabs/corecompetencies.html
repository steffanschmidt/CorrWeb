                    It should be note that this part will be very much alike what can be found on the resume.
                    The purpose is to provide a fast overview with linking to other resources found on this site, where these compentencies are explained in greater detail. Below you will see some buttons and if
                    you click them, then my current interests are or what I am working on in that specific area will be listed. These are not shown per default because it is work in progress compentency wise, and
                    there are some, which I do not have time to work on.

                    I have a master degree in <a href="nanoscience.html">Nanoscience</a>, where I specialized in the field of materials science. Nanoscience in short is the focus on matter on the nanoscale.
                    In other words atoms. Therefore there is a natural focus on techniques used for characterizing stuff on this level. Nanoscience is still in its infancy education wise, hence it is, from my
                    experience, not that known in general. However it allows for a greater understanding of the macroscropic properties observed. One of the strengths of a Nanoscience is the true interdisciplinary
                    nature. By that I mean interdisciplinarity is used a lot these days, hence the meaning has been a bit diluted, but a Nanoscientist has knowledge from all the classical areas of natural sciences
                    (physics, chemistry, biology and molecular biology) and has a strong foundation to develop these competencies with a unique perspective and inspiration from other fields.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you want to know more, I do encourage you to read more about Nanoscience, but in short you cannot really go wrong, if you choose a Nanoscientist.

                <p>
                    I have a very broad knowledge within this field, since it was the field I specialized in. Some examples of theses areas are soft matter (eg. polymers), inorganic materials
                    both in and outside biological environments, biomaterials (eg. implants) and metals. Within all of these I have gained a thorough knowledge on both the theoretical and practical
                    level, but mostly the former during my studies. These more theoretical courses includes surface physics, solid state physics, semiconductors, thermodynamics and much more.
                    Apart from my theoretical knowledge I have hands-on experience dealing with materials as can be read a bit further down on this page. Since my knowledge within this field
                    is quite broad, I would advise you contact me, if you have any questions, since then I can be more specific.

                        As mentioned in the extra materials section most of my work is tied theoretical work. Other than corrosion I have two keen interest. These are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The ability of metals to protect themselves against corrosion and how to describe this mathematically to predict lifetimes.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Bioinspired coatings for protections against corrosion. Namely arresting the corrosion process by allowing corrosion to occur in the initial stages to form
                                and oxide layer and having the coating on top for stability and stopping the process by interacting with ions.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Superconductors.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Quantum Electrodynamics.

                    <p>
                        However due to the nature of the two last topics it is not something I have pursued, but some time in the future, I hope I can do that.

                <p>
                    Chemistry was my main work area both during my bachelors and masters project. I focused on using a broad range of synthesis strategies and rather than sticking to one single compound
                    I worked with several. However I aimed at synthesizing perovskites due to their interesting properties and also double perovskites. Furthermore I also had a big focus on osmates. The
                    different synthesis methods I worked with were:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Solid state synthesis - oxidating, reducing, inert environment</li>
                        <li>Quartz tube synthesis and crystal growth - great control over environment and possibility for a small pressure</li>
                        <li>Sol gel chemistry - Pechini method, aqueous solutions with different metal coordinators</li>
                        <li>Wet chemistry</li>
                        <li>High pressure synthesis - extreme conditions that resembles those found inside the Earth</li>
                    </ul>
                    Furthermore I characterized all my powder samples with PXRD, hence I have a huge experience with powder characterization. Lastly apart from my obligations to synthesize these compound,
                    I also worked with a bunch of practical projects due to my experience with CAD and machining.

                        Since chemistry is an area I have worked a lot, I am more focused on applying the methods I learned where I can to my other interest. However I do want to improve my abilities in
                        <em>organic chemistry</em>, since it ties neatly together with coatings for corrosion protection purposes. Also it is a topic that I have not worked with in a while, hence I want
                        to get my competencies within this field refreshed.

                <p>
                    As a result of my background in Nanoscience, I am very much used to scripting and working with data and analyzing it in general. Understanding and interpreting the results obtained
                    from these analyses is therefore comes naturally to me as it is how I am used to used. However since I finished my studies in 2017, I have made huge progess within this field, and
                    programming is a strong interest of mine, hence this trend will only continue. I encourage you to read about my skills in programming by following the link in the title.
                    To summarize I will divide my competencies within this field from my own subjective point of view. <br />
                    <strong>High proficiency:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Python</li>
                        <li>Matlab</li>
                    </ul>
                    <strong>Medium proficiency:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>JavaScript</li>
                        <li>HTML</li>
                        <li>CSS</li>

                        I want to emphasize that this is my own ranking, and even though I rate something as "lower profiency", then it does not mean I cannot write in that language. I just need more hours of
                        programming to feel comfortable with the different syntax. Furthermore if you should be willing to give me a chance to improve in an area of your interest, I will gladly do so.

                        Programming along with my technical/practical competencies are the two areas, I improve the most right now. Therefore I am actively working on these, some more than others though. These are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <em>Python</em> - Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Image processing and recognition (edge detection etc.).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <em>Databases</em> - Mostly MySQL where I plan to set up a local database on my computer to store corrosion data.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <em>Cloud Computing</em> - In combination with database development I want access to a real-time feed of my data and process these rather than having to wait for the experiment to
                                be finished.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <em>Microcontrollers</em> - Controlling motors, heating, IoT and much more.

                <div class="subtitle"><p class="listHeading">Mathematical modelling, Statistics, Optimization og Simulation:</p></div>
                <p>
                    From my studies I got a strong mathematical knowledge with statistics and how these are used in science.
                    I used my mathematical toolbox from my studies when I was hired at Terma in order to <a href="theoretical.html#theoryTerma">model corrosion</a>.
                    Furthermore I used my knowledge from statistics in order to verify my model on the data. Therefore I have hands on experience with applying my theoretical knowledge in practice.
                    Lastly I always attempt to be innovative within this field, since I have always enjoyed working with math. Hence it is very entertaining to me to explore and predict the consequences
                    of theories. This combined with my programming experience has become a very powerful tool for me. Namely this allows me to find solutions to problems and optimizing it by fine tuning
                    the parameters. Furthermore I can use my knowledge of simulation to gain a unique insight into the consequences of choosing certain values or setups which can help even further when
                    attempting to develop products or make predictions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is a subject that I always use. It is a tool for me, hence it is always possible to improve. However there is no particular subject I am working due to the nature of it.
                    Therefore you can expect that this will be a topic I continously work on as a consequence of my projects and/or interest listed on this page.

                <div class="subtitle"><p class="listHeading"><a href="practical.html#designPrototyping">CAD Design, Electronics and Prototyping - Machining and 3D printing:</a></p></div>
                <p>
                    Following my bachelors project I got a machining workshop course at Aarhus University during the summer break (2015). I upgraded this with a one month practice I finished in March 2019.
                    However since I got the course after my bachelors, I have been working with prototype development and CAD design (Autodesk Inventor). My first major project was during my masters project 
                    where I worked with making <a href="chemistry.html#ceramicsMolds">Ceramic Components</a> for high pressure synthesis. I have been making test setups in order to continue the research on my own. 
                    As a result of that 3D printing is an important tool of mine, and since I own my 3D printer, I also have  quite a lot of experience with using these and making designs for printing. 
                    Apart from this I also have quite a lot of hands-on experience with machining. This is both with manuel  machining (milling or lathe) and CNC, where I worked with metals 
                    (mostly aluminium, stainless steel, brass), plastics (PTFE, POM, PE, PLA) and wood (soft wood, compact laminate). Other than that I know a bit about <a href="practical.html#electronics">
                    Electronics and Microcontrollers</a> due to my designing my own test design for corrosion experiment.
                    To summarize my technical competencies are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>CAD design (Autodesk Inventor)</li>
                        <li>Machining both manually and on CNC</li>
                        <li>3D Printing</li>
                        <li>Electronics and Microcontrollers</li>

                    <p>
                        I am working on quite a bit with regards to my practical experience. Namely since I am actively working on my own private corrosion research, I am designing test setups and measurement
                        equipment. This is a topic that I am rapidly gaining knowledge in and the current stuff I am working on is:
                        <ul>
                            <li>IoT and Cloud computing</li>

                            <li>Motor control (step motors)</li>
                            <li>Temperature feed-back loop</li>
                            <li>Precision measurements and signal amplification</li>
                            <li>LCD displays</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="subtitle"><p class="listHeading"><a href="theoretical.html#theoryTerma">Corrosion theory and lifetime prediction:</a></p></div>
                <p>
                    I got interested in corrosion due to my job at Terma. The goal with predict lifetime of products under galvanic corrosion and screen materials in order
                    to improve both product quality and determine when a potential maintenance was required. Since Terma has antennas placed in different environments all around the world, it was critically
                    important that the model was generalized and could be applied to anywhere. Hence unlike HACT experiments and the like, it was necessary to determine corrosion spreading throughout the
                    entire process, rather than pictures of the end result or in timed intervals. After Terma most of the theory has pretty much stayed the same and instead I have been working on designing
                    test setups by learning how to design electronic circuits and programming microcontrollers. <br />
                    Most of my work within this field is still to come but I am actively gathering data from eight experiments at the same time. However I will note that I do not have enough time to do all 
                    of this due to my job search and other obligations, since I am doing it in my spare time and I have a limited amount of money available. <br />
                    <em>Therefore If you are interested in corrosion and possible want to establish a partnership, feel free to contant me.</em>
