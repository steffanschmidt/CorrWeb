                                Simulation made in Matlab of a ball in a box showing my skills and interest.
                                This was made shortly after I graduated in order to show that I could program and make simulations in Matlab.

                        Matlab was the first language I ever learned how to program in. Before then I only experimented a bit with macros in Excel.
                        This happened during my second year at university in the course "Computational Physics". In this course I learned about a lot of the basics in
                        programming and how to do plot stuff, solve equation for an unknown, integrate, solve differentiel equation and simulate.
                        However it was not until I had to work with it at <a href="theoretical.html#theoryTerma">Terma</a> that I really learned how things worked.
                        For me this was the beginning of a much larger interest for programming in general and during the last couple of months at Terma, I learned
                        how to work build and work with interfaces.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After Terma I continued my programming adventure and since I wanted to learn more about creating interfaces, I started making another one
                        for my former supervisor at inorganic chemistry. This was meant to analyze data from high pressure experiments with different models for
                        Equation of State (EoS) and make it easy to compare the results of these models to determine which one was best suited to describe the data.
                        Other than that I helped some of the younger students with scripting and I wrote some myself. Most notably a plotting tool that automated the
                        tedious process of plotting the results and bragg peaks/positions from rietveld refinements. This method is used all the time in inorganic chemistry
                        for powder analysis, hence it would save a lot of time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To summarize my most important competencies in Matlab are:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Analyzing data and plotting the results.</li>
                        <li>Solving (differentials) equations and integrating.</li>
                        <li>Making simulations.</li>
                        <li>Designing interfaces.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The design of interfaces made me more aware of Object-Oriented programming (OOP) and the concepts behind it. However it was not until I started learning
                        Python that I really actually made "true" OOP. Even since then I have been programming in Python, which will be covered below.

                                At first it was not intended to be a video, but due to how easy Python made it to do so.
                                I had a lot of fun making it, hence I added some text and chose to share my experience on LinkedIn as well.

                        I started learning Python shortly after I finished my studies in <a href="nanoscience.html">Nanoscience</a> in the summer 2017. This was partly because it
                        seemed to be "the new thing" and partly because it was freeware. In any case after getting used to how Python works I have not looked back.
                        As mentioned before I got interested in Object-Oriented programming from my experience with developing interfaces, hence it was a logical place to start,
                        since I knew most of the basics from Matlab. My first large project in Python was an interactive resume. It was intended to supplement my regular resume,
                        but add more detailed information and allow for the use to more selectively read about their topic of interest. I suspected that even though it is not a
                        harmful code, then nobody would run it, hence I made a video showcasing its features, which you can see a video of here (left). Since then I have developed a couple of 
                        interfaces and picked up a couple of tricks along the way to make it better and smarter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Apart from interface development I can do most of the things I learned in Matlab in Python. However one of the major things I did not know how to make was simulations.
                        The concept is of course the same. Initiate and move the object(s) in question, but in order to get more experience with it, I started making a simulation just for fun.
                        This started with a simple project of moving basic geometries and turned into polygons at which point I decided to pick it up a notch. Therefore I came up with a concept
                        of a man traversing different terrains symbolizing how I felt when learning new stuff is and why it is important. Mostly to share my experience and show how much fun I had
                        making it on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/steffanschmidt/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>. The video I made can be seen here (right). It was also a step up in complexity 
                        from my previous Matlab video not only in the sense of more complex shapes, but also with video editing. Although I am still very much a novice when it comes to the latter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With all that blabbering out of the way now comes the real stuff namely data analysis techniques. I have had a keen interest in it mostly due to my background in natural science.
                        Even though mathematical modelling can get one far, then sometimes there simply are too many parameters or unknown factors. Therefore I started to learn machine learning (ML),
                        where I got knowledge about K-nearest neighbor, support vector machine (SVM) and a bit about kernels. However I did not get to clustering because I instead begun with learning
                        the principles and ideas behind neutral networks. Most importantly I have learned how to much tools such as TensorFlow and Keras, where I have encountered a bunch of different
                        techniques within the field of artificial intelligence. Most notably sequential models, RNN and LSTM, where the latter has mainly interested me for natural language processing.
                        However I do admit I lack some practical experience in this field as I have not yet found a real application for it in my every day life. Lastly it should be mentioned I also
                        spend some time learning about image and video analysis with OpenCV mainly for edge recognition.
