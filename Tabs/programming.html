                    Most of my programming experience stems from data analysis throughout and after my studies in <a href="nanoscience.html">Nanoscience</a>.
                    However I have been interested in it for quite some time, but it was not until around 2014, and I have learned a lot since then.
                    If you are interested in programming, it is the area where I am improving the most, and I am also willing to learn, if I get the chance to.
                    It does not really matter what language it is or which specific topic, it is about, because I thoroughly enjoy programming. Even though there is
                    room for improvement, then it is not a matter of willingness, rather it is a question of I do not know what topic to focus on. 
                    In any case I have a quite wide range of experience, as you will be able to read below.

                                Simulation made in Matlab of a ball in a box showing my skills and interest.
                                This was made shortly after I graduated in order to show that I could program and make simulations in Matlab.

                    <p>
                        Matlab was the first language I ever learned how to program in. Before then I only experimented a bit with macros in Excel.
                        This happened during my second year at university in the course "Computational Physics". In this course I learned about a lot of the basics in
                        programming and how to do plot stuff, solve equation for an unknown, integrate, solve differentiel equation and simulate.
                        However it was not until I had to work with it at <a href="theoretical.html#theoryTerma">Terma</a> that I really learned how things worked.
                        For me this was the beginning of a much larger interest for programming in general and during the last couple of months at Terma, I learned
                        how to work build and work with interfaces.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After Terma I continued my programming adventure and since I wanted to learn more about creating interfaces, I started making another one
                        for my former supervisor at inorganic chemistry. This was meant to analyze data from high pressure experiments with different models for
                        Equation of State (EoS) and make it easy to compare the results of these models to determine which one was best suited to describe the data.
                        Other than that I helped some of the younger students with scripting and I wrote some myself. Most notably a plotting tool that automated the
                        tedious process of plotting the results and bragg peaks/positions from rietveld refinements. This method is used all the time in inorganic chemistry
                        for powder analysis, hence it would save a lot of time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To summarize my most important competencies in Matlab are:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Analyzing data and plotting the results.</li>
                        <li>Solving (differentials) equations and integrating.</li>
                        <li>Making simulations.</li>
                        <li>Designing interfaces.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The design of interfaces made me more aware of Object-Oriented programming (OOP) and the concepts behind it. However it was not until I started learning
                        Python that I really actually made "true" OOP. Ever since then I have been programming in Python, which will be covered below.

                    <p>
                        I started learning Python shortly after I finished my studies in <a href="nanoscience.html">Nanoscience</a> in the summer 2017. This was partly because it
                        seemed to be "the new thing" and partly because it was freeware. In any case after getting used to how Python works I have not looked back.
                        As mentioned before I got interested in Object-Oriented programming from my experience with developing interfaces, hence it was a logical place to start,
                        since I knew most of the basics from Matlab. My first large project in Python was an interactive resume. It was intended to supplement my regular resume,
                        but add more detailed information and allow for the use to more selectively read about their topic of interest. I suspected that even though it is not a
                        harmful code, then nobody would run it, hence I made a video showcasing its features, which you can see a video of here (left). Since then I have developed a couple of 
                        interfaces and picked up a couple of tricks along the way to make it better and smarter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Apart from interface development I can do most of the things I learned in Matlab in Python. However one of the major things I did not know how to make was simulations.
                        The concept is of course the same. Initiate and move the object(s) in question, but in order to get more experience with it, I started making a simulation just for fun.
                        This started with a simple project of moving basic geometries and turned into polygons at which point I decided to pick it up a notch. Therefore I came up with a concept
                        of a man traversing different terrains symbolizing how I felt when learning new stuff is and why it is important. Mostly to share my experience and show how much fun I had
                        making it on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/steffanschmidt/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>. The video I made can be seen here (right). It was also a step up in complexity 
                        from my previous Matlab video not only in the sense of more complex shapes, but also with video editing. Although I am still very much a novice when it comes to the latter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With all that blabbering out of the way now comes the real stuff namely data analysis techniques. I have had a keen interest in it mostly due to my background in natural science.
                        Even though mathematical modelling can get one far, then sometimes there simply are too many parameters or unknown factors. Therefore I started to learn machine learning (ML),
                        where I got knowledge about K-nearest neighbor, support vector machine (SVM) and a bit about kernels. However I did not get to clustering because I instead begun with learning
                        the principles and ideas behind neutral networks. Most importantly I have learned how to much tools such as TensorFlow and Keras, where I have encountered a bunch of different
                        techniques within the field of artificial intelligence. Most notably sequential models, RNN and LSTM, where the latter has mainly interested me for natural language processing.
                        However I do admit I lack some practical experience in this field as I have not yet found a real application for it in my every day life. Lastly it should be mentioned I also
                        spend some time learning about image and video analysis with OpenCV mainly for edge recognition.
                    </p>
                    <p>In any case to summarize my most important competencies in Python are: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Data analysis and plotting.</li>

            <section id="fullStack">
                <div class="h2Box"><h2>Frontend and Backend Programming</h2></div>
                <p>
                    Firstly I want to mention that I just recently finished (January 2019) a FullStack Developer course, which was held by Itucation. It was a ten week course, where I learned all
                    of the topics described below and I got a MS 70-480 certificate. Most of the stuff I have some experience with, but I lack the experience I have with Matlab and Python in order
                    to really capitalize on these skills. Therefore I will be very brief, and if you have a question, I encourage you to send me an email or just call me.
                </p>
                <div class="generalPurposeBox">
                    <div class="subtitle"><p>HTML, CSS and JavaScript</p></div>
                    <p>
                        This section is quite explanatory on its own, since it is these languages this entire site is written in. This is also the skills that MS 70-480 certificate is based on.
                        However it is worth mentioning that apart from the skills written in the section title, then I have also worked with <em>jQuery, JSON and XML</em> in order to make request
                        to databases. Furthermore as can be seen from my website it is also rudimentary in many regards. This is partly due to the fact it is hosted on Github, which only allows
                        static website, and partly because I still have a lot to learn within this field. However it should be noted there is a lot of things I have learned, but have not used on this site,
                        because it did not make a lot of sense to include (for example forms, simple login system, drag and drop events etc.).
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="generalPurposeBox">
                    <div class="subtitle"><p>C# and MVC</p></div>
                    <p>
                        In the C# part of the course I learned all the basics of C#. This was mostly based around object oriented programming with its constructors and a bit of asynchronous programming
                        and threading. Therefore I was also introduced to the different modifiers. Furthermore I also worked with LINQ just like with JavaScripts XML requests. I also worked a bit with
                        testing, debugging and safety such as . However most of the C# part was based on working with the main topic namely MVC. In MVC I learned about the three main concepts parts of MVC,
                        where I learned how to create a website with routing in MVC and safety with encryption and authentication with a login system and how to implement external authentication.
                        This also included working with Razor. Lastly it should be mentioned that I worked with databases and how to make request and populate these in MVC.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="generalPurposeBox">
                    <div class="subtitle"><p>SQL</p></div>
                    <p>
                        SQL was about 1.5 week of the entire course, where I learned how to set up a database, populate it and make queries directly in SQL. This includes most of the basics of SQL
                        such as the keywords used. However unfortunately for all of us attending the course, the SQL part was cut short due to the teacher getting sick. Hence I will admit that SQL
                        is my weakest subject knowledge wise of the FullStack package. However I do find that it is quite easy to understand, so if this is of interest to you, I will just learn it.
                        It is also my plan to use in my own project, which will be covered in the next section, where my plan is to save data from my experiments in a database for real-time monitoring
                        and IoT integration.

                <div class="generalPurposeBox">
                    <div class="subtitle"><p>A derivate of C++</p></div>
                    <p>
                        Microcontrollers caught my interest due to making my own setup for corrosion experiments over long spans of time. You can see the <a href="practical.html#electronics">Practical Work</a>
                        part of that endeavour. This section is devoted to shortly explain what I worked with on the programming side. Arduino/Teensy programming is based on a derivative of C++.
                        Therefore I had to learn the basic concepts of C++. Luckily it is similar to what I had worked with in Python at that time, since it was before my FullStack developer course.
                        In my case I worked with precise measurement and logging of corrosion voltage. Hence I worked with circular arrays, logging onto an SD card and ensuring it was connected before any
                        measurement could start and of course defining all the logic for the inputs/outputs. Furthermore I experimented with IoT and setting up local servers in order to control the experiment
                        based on the real-time monitoring and extract information during it. Lastly I implemented a start/pause button based on a simple counter. This is of course only a small fraction of the
                        entire project, since the hard part is optimizing the outcome between the versatility in the programming part and understanding what electronics part to use and their physical limitations.
                        In any case I will be more than happy to give further details in case <em><strong>test design</strong></em> is of interest to you.
