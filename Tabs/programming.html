                                Simulation made in Matlab of a ball in a box showing my skills and interest.
                                This was made shortly after I graduated in order to show that I could program and make simulations in Matlab.

                        Matlab was the first language I ever learned how to program in. Before then I only experimented a bit with macros in Excel.
                        This happened during my second year at university in the course "Computational Physics". In this course I learned about a lot of the basics in
                        programming and how to do plot stuff, solve equation for an unknown, integrate, solve differentiel equation and simulate.
                        However it was not until I had to work with it at <a href="theoretical.html#theoryTerma">Terma</a> that I really learned how things worked.
                        For me this was the beginning of a much larger interest for programming in general and during the last couple of months at Terma, I learned
                        how to work build and work with interfaces.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After Terma I continued my programming adventure and since I wanted to learn more about creating interfaces, I started making another one
                        for my former supervisor at inorganic chemistry. This was meant to analyze data from high pressure experiments with different models for
                        Equation of State (EoS) and make it easy to compare the results of these models to determine which one was best suited to describe the data.
                        Other than that I helped some of the younger students with scripting and I wrote some myself. Most notably a plotting tool that automated the
                        tedious process of plotting the results and bragg peaks/positions from rietveld refinements. This method is used all the time in inorganic chemistry
                        for powder analysis, hence it would save a lot of time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To summarize my most important competencies in Matlab are:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Analyzing data and plotting the results.</li>
                        <li>Solving (differentials) equations and integrating.</li>
                        <li>Making simulations.</li>
                        <li>Designing interfaces.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        It was also at this time, I started being interested in Python, which I have been programming in ever since.

                                At first it was not intended to be a video, but due to how easy Python made it to do so.
                                I had a lot of fun making it, hence I added some text and chose to share my experience on LinkedIn as well.

                                It was intended to supplement my regular resume, and it was my first interface made in Python, so it served a dual purpose.
