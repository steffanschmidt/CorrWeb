                    I want to start off with a small disclaimer. All of the text below are meant to give you a more in-depth understanding of who I am, and what I enjoy doing besides work. Although this can
                    overlap quite frequently, then I will try not to include work related stuff below. Therefore if my person does not interest you that much, then I advise you to save your time and skip it.
                    Nevertheless I will say this, I am very much down to earth. I do enjoy speculating and using theoretical knowledge to develop theories and test them. As a result sometimes I can get some
                    wild ideas, some of which cannot be realized, but it is a part of my DNA to improve and optimize. I will be the first to admit that I am a huge nerd, and therefore lot of what I enjoy 
                    doing is described in the other tabs.

                    <p>
                        In general I believe that continous learning and reflection are very important aspects both to grow personally and professionally. I spend a great deal of time on the former with
                        programming and working on <a href="practical.html#designPrototyping">Practical Projects</a>. I always attempt to keep up to date, and I start to feel stuck
                        when I do the same thing over and over again. Therefore it is very important to me that the work I do has either meaning or a concrete outcome either in the form of
                        product or new discoveries (eg. in natural science). In other words development is one of the keywords for me. Regarding reflection then it has a two-fold meaning in this case. Namely
                        self-reflection and scientific reflection. The latter is the one I enjoy the most is reflecting on consequences of say some theory or assumption in natural science.
                        For example if I attempt to develop a theory for corrosion, and I assume that I can describe all external factors on it, how will this show in measurements and how will it affect
                        the outcome, and if I change this certain parameter what will happen i.e. what is the physical interpretation of this value.
                        However self-reflection is of critical importance to me, since it is basically everything else. For me it is mostly in the form how other perceive me and what effect some action
                        will have. In general and especially during the entirety of my job search, I spend a lot of time on this.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I do wish to come across as the very down to earth person I am, despite my occational obsession with natural sciences and development.
                        Hopefully I can convince you of that with the sections below and on this site in general.

                    <p>
                        I love to see things grow and flourish in general, and therefore I do very much enjoy working with plants and taking care of them. The process of planting is enjoyable
                        and relaxing to me and I like a wide variety of plants. However I am really fond of succulents because partly they are easy to take care of and partly due the fact they come
                        in a wide variety. The simple look is also appealing to me rather than having flower bearing plants. I also like cacti for the same reasons. Therefore I have been gathering
                        myself a small greenhouse worth of succulent plants over the last couple of years due to offsets from my plants. Other than that I have about 60 strawberry plants on
                        my terrace, some of which can seen here just before budding last year. Unfortunately due to the space constraints their yield is not that great, since they need a lot more
                        room to grow. Nevertheless the outcome that do come is greatly appreciated and tastes delicious.

                        On a sidenote I have a small dream that some time in the future I will have myself a garden, where I expand my collection of plants and grow things for cooking.
                    </p>

                <div class="generalPurposeBox">
                    <div class="subtitle"><p>Cooking and Baking</p></div>
                    <p>
                        Cooking is one of the things I do really like doing, hence I put a lot energy into it. On a daily basis this to me is where I have time to relax or spend time to reflect and/or 
                        generate new ideas. It varies from day to day whether or not I can to spend a lot of time on it, but in general I do like to make a proper evening meal every day. 
                        Other than that I attempt to vary my cooking and learn new recipes in order to mix things up from time to time. I personally like to have a basic recipe for a certain thing
                        and then change that rather than finding new ones every single time, I want to try something new. In any case cooking is a passion of mine and the more stuff I can make from 
                        scratch the happier I am.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Apart from cooking I decide to bake once a while. It is usually something I do, when I feel like it, or if I have an appointment where say a cake would be nice. It brings all the
                        same comforts for me as cooking does, however one can only eat so much cake. Therefore usually when I make a cake I do it out of interest rather than eating it on my own. In other
                        words it is not unlikely that I try to get rid of it by sharing it with friends, family and/or colleagues.
                    </p>

                <div class="generalPurposeBox">
                    <div class="subtitle"><p>Politics and Finance</p></div>
                    <p>
                        In general I have a keen interest in politics, and I like to discuss it. This is especially true when it comes to financial stuff as I like to think strategically when it comes to
                        finances whether it is private economy or in a company. However even though maximizing profit is important in both cases I do believe that there needs to be a balance so the values
                        actually are upheld. By that I mean if one takes pride in working with sustainability or development, then this should also be emphasized in the financial expenditure and how one
                        works on a daily basis. Personally I have been investing in stocks since 2012, hence I follow the stock market every single day. Therefore I am very much aware of expenditures and 
                        minimizing it, but at the same time trying to optimize the outcome by using all the tools at ones disposal. This is something I do myself as you can see on my <a href="practical.html#machining">
                        Corrosion Work</a> with regards to both theoretical and practical work. However in other words even though I am a scientist at heart when developing and would love to have financial freedom, 
                        then I am also reluctant to spend money unless it is necessary just like a private economy.
