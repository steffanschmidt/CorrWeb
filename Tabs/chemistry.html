                    This section will give a brief description of my work at Aarhus University at Inorganic Chemistry.
                    I used a wide range of techniques with the intention to explore and combine the methods to use the strengths of each of these.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore I did a large literature study on Osmates to explore structures of interest and find out which may be stabilized and under which circumstances.
                    This resulted in an extensive "database" and combined with tolerance factors enabled me to find candidates of interest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apart from my synthesis and literature study, I did practical project due to my solid knowledge in design and development of prototypes and test setups.
                    This is further elaborated in <a href="practical.html">Practical Work</a> and the main project during my masters is described below.
