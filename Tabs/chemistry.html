                    This section will give a brief description of my work at Aarhus University at Inorganic Chemistry. My main focus was osmium compounds and perovskites in general.
                    I used a wide range of techniques with the intention to explore and combine the methods to use the strengths of each of these. I characterized all my samples with PXRD.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore I did a large literature study on osmates to explore structures of interest and find out which may be stabilized and under which circumstances.
                    This resulted in an extensive "database" and combined with tolerance factors enabled me to find candidates of interest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apart from my synthesis and literature study, I did practical project due to my solid knowledge in design and development of prototypes and test setups.
                    This is further elaborated in <a href="practical.html">Practical Work</a> and the main project during my masters is described below.

                            I made a broad range of solid state reactions during my masters project, some of which were more colorful than other. These represent the average color as most samples ended
                            up with a light gray to black color. The samples seen here are placed on sample holders for PXRD. From left to right the compounds are: SrNiO3, BaNiO3, BaMnO3.

                    <p>
                        Solid state synthesis is the method I have most experience with. I worked with both a "classical" approach where one creates a precursor of different powders and pressing it into a pellet.
                        This was followed by heating it and I usually had a gas flow as well. This was either oxygen, hydrogen/argon or argon flow depending on what was required. For a some samples I combined
                        this by oxidizing the precursor fully first in order to reduce (with hydrogen flow) and characterize the outcome in certain intervals. Argon was used for creating an inert
                        environment when heating. Furthermore if I wanted a better control reaction environment and a small pressure during heating, I put the pellet into a quartz tube,
                        evacuated it (created a vacuum) and sealed the tube. Apart from the sample I put a pellet of oxidizing material into the tube. This could be sodium chlorate or potassium perchlorate.
                        This was the one I used most frequently due to the ease of synthesis.

                        To summarize I worked with:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Reaction of powders under gas flow (oxygen, hydrogen/argon, argon)</li>
                            <li>High pressure synthesis</li>
                            <li>Quartz tube reactions</li>
                            <li>Crystal growth</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lastly it is worth mentioning that this is only a very small fraction of the work I did. I made a ton of solid state synthesis, and if you are interest in that or in powder characterization,
                        it is something I spend a great deal of time on during my studies.

                        During my masters project solid state synthesis was my main focus, but instead of only working with osmium compounds, I expanded to perovskites in general with a heavy focus on combining
                        techniques. What I mean by this is that some reaction in fluids allow for stabilization of high valence states than what is possible in solid state reactions. Therefore one could imagine
                        making a pure precusor from sol gel chemistry of a wanted compounds. Then following that putting the powder into high pressure and temperature conditions and see how this affects the
                        crystal structure. Therefore I spend a couple of months during my masters project working with sol gel and comparing these to the results my solid state reactions. This way I could also
                        really make a lot of samples, since it is easy to do a bunch of parallel experiments. In any case I did get some interesting results, but unfortunately I started with it too late in my
                        master project to pursue it it more thoroughly. The technique I worked with were:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The Pechini method</li>
                            <li>Aqueous solutions - citric acid, oxalic acid and urea as coordinators</li>
                        </ul>
                        Especially the Pechini method was of big interest to me, and it was also the method that gave the most promising results.

                <div class="generalPurposeBox">
                    <div class="subtitle"><p>Wet Chemistry</p></div>
                    <p>
                        I used wet chemistry both during laboratory exercises and as a part of my bachelor project. I will only address the latter. I worked with osmium and most of the techniques I found
                        was prevalently solid state reactions. However there are some drawbacks to this as osmium can form osmium tetraoxide, which is very toxic. Furthermore usually I quite large amount of
                        osmium was lost due to this. Therefore I decided to attempt to synthesize compounds with wet chemistry and compare this to the results I found from my solid state reactions and the
                        literature. However it was not my main focus, and sadly I did not really get any notable results from my wet chemistry experiments. Nevertheless it is a technique I am quite familiar
                        with and also led me toward sol gel chemistry as described above.

                            some ceramic components, a graphite furnace and a thermocouple. The entire setup consists of many parts each of which plays an important role in controlling the 
                            synthesis conditions and the sample is inside either a gold or platinum capsule.

                            the cube assembly (see right picture) together to create the high pressure onto the sample.

                    Even though high pressure synthesis is technically a solid state reaction it is very different compared to the average synthesis. The high pressure apparatus placed in the basement at Aarhus University
                    where both high pressure and temperature can be achieved. You can read more about <a href="http://chem.au.dk/forskning/forskningscentre/center-for-materials-crystallography/research/high-pressure-synthesis/" target="_blank"> high pressure synthesis</a>
                    on Aarhus University's website. In any case it is a very extreme technique, where it is possible to recreate conditions found in the center of the Earth. For me it was not unusual to work with
                    6 GPa of pressure and 1500 degrees celsius to give an idea of the conditions. For comparison I would make reactions at 1000 degrees celsius during a regular solid state synthesis with a maximum of about 5 Pa.
                    The idea is to create novel materials that may be stabilized under these conditions and hopefully be stable at ambient conditions. However due to the extreme nature it requires a special setup with very specifically 
                    chosen materials in order to make it work. Furthermore this setup has to be carefully assembled in order to minimize error and ensure replicability.

                    As mentioned in the above section high pressure synthesis the components for the setup were chosen in order to satisfy certain requirements. These requirements were usually for thermal
                    thermal and electrical insulation. Some of the ceramics though were only used as a barrier to make the temperature gradient between different parts of the setup mild. Nevertheless
                    it was an important part of my masters project to attempt to create these components due to my experience with <a href="practical.html">practical work and CAD</a>. It is also the reason why
                    I got responsibility for a tabletop CNC in the first place. In any case these parts had to have a very small tolerance, since they had to fit nearly together. Furthermore they should approach
                    the commercial products quality. These were the two main requirements, but I imposed a third one on myself, namely that it had to be a flexible and fast process to make them. The reason for this
                    was because it had to be a part of a weekly routine filled with other obligations. <br />
                    Some of the components were made of alumina (Al2O3) and/or magnesium oxide (MgO), whereas a few others were made of zirconia (ZrO2). To make it a bit easier I had a commercial powder consiting of 
                    2/3 alumina and 1/3 MgO. This was combined with an activator and following that it would react to form a soft ceramic component. Therefore my first priority was the creation of molds. You can see
                    one of these on the right, which was for making octahedron. However since I did not have a commercial mixture available to me with regards to zirconia, I made a ceramic polymer. Therefore I learned
                    stuff about organic binders, plasticizers and dispersants, because it was necessary to obtain a proper result. Furthermore this allowed me to work with injection molding, which was not possible for
                    the commercial solution due to its heavy reactivity on compression (it practically became a solid on compression).
                </p>
                <p>
                    To make a long story short I never really achieved commercial product quality, but from my experience with producing ceramic components I learned:
