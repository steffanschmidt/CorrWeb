                <p>
                    Nanoscience is the study is the nanoscale or in other words the atomic level. These days a lot of research is being done in order to understand
                    what happens on this scale and how we can control it. Small is different and that is visibly true in churches all around Europe as the coloring of the
                    glass is done by nanoparticles ground to different sizes. Hence the properties of things change when science is on that scale. Now when I started studying
                    Nanoscience my dream was to control atoms and construct from a bottom-up approach rather to top-down. This is far from reality just yet, at least on a large scale.
                    One of the core pillars in Nanoscience is the idea of being interdisciplinary. That is not to say other fields are not, but while a Chemist is really strong in
                    chemistry, I have skills within physics, chemistry, biology and molecularbiology. Therefore I can understand the terminology used to a high or some degree in all fields.
                    Furthermore due to the "Nano" focus, characterization of the nanoscale is of critical importance.

                <div class="h2Box"><h2>What can I, as a Nanoscientist, contribute with?</h2></div>
                <p>
                    Since Nanoscience is an interdisciplinary field, then I can be sort of a translator between different fields of natural sciences. Not only that I can draw inspiration
                    from the other fields and find solutions. For example in the field of implants the understanding of biology and biocompatibility is of critical importance, which I got
                    some knowledge about. Another example could be corrosion, since it is an interplay between physics and chemistry. Understanding electrochemistry on a simple level and
                    applying concepts of Electrodynamics and Surface Physics to this field makes for an interesting way of thinking about corrosion. In other words it is possible to combine
                    the best of both worlds and understanding how a concept in chemistry and translate it to phyiscs and their terms. Even though this could seem like a lack of specialization,
                    it is not the case and in my case I have focused on materials science ranging from the inorganic materials found in our bodies to the theory of metals and their properties.
                    That is the true strength of Nanoscience, namely the capability to take on most subjects without having to start from scratch and have the knowledge on how to get things
                    started.

                    In short I, as a Nanoscientist, can contribute with:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Materials Science ranging from Biomaterials and Polymers to the theory of Metallic properties.</li>
                        <li>A broad knowledge foundation in most natural sciences with the ability to understand the different termonologies.</li>
                        <li>A solid mathematical toolkit combined with the physical understanding of the world from physics.</li>
                        <li>Data science, spotting trends and number crunching in front of a computer.</li>
                        <li>Mathematical modelling with inspiration from other fields and a creative mind that can think out of the box.</li>
                        <li>Safety aspects of working in a laboratory, documentation and development.</li>
                        <li>Characterization Techniques and quality assurance.</li>
                    </ul>
                    This last one will be covered further below.

                <div class="h2Box"><h2>Characterization on the Nanoscale</h2></div>
                <p>
                    Characterization is of utmost importance to Nanoscience as mentioned earlier. Therefore a great deal of effort goes into understanding how different microscopy techniques work
                    and how to analyze the images that are obtained when using these. Furthermore it is even more important in the case, where one is working on the atomic level to visualize the
                    effects done by the technique chosen. By this I mean for example if a Nanoscientist attempts to get a nanoscale coating, then it is important to actually see the outcome in
                    order to understand the macroscopic effects observed. Nanoscience uses microscopy techniques such as SPM (Scanning Probe Microscopy), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and
                    Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) to see on the nanometer level. I personally have used Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), which is of type SPM, and I have training in using
                    SEM.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are a bunch of other techniques readily available to a Nanoscientist, and it is important to mention that I have knowledge of characterization technqiues from
                    chemistry, physics and (molecular)biology. Therefore I can easily adapt to any given situation and learn the core concepts and how a machine work within a short span of time.
                    To summarize the versatility of Nanoscience and the knowledge obtained throughout the study of Nanoscience gives so many tools and options for future development and an open
                    mind to other solutions than found in a single field of natural science.
