                            across the surface. This can be done in different modes to either achieve a better resolution, minimize damage on the sample in question
                            or characterize in fluids. The most basic form is contact mode, where the cantilever pushes against the surface and its deflection is observed.

                    Nanoscience is the study is the nanoscale or in other words the atomic level. These days a lot of research is being done in order to understand
                    what happens on this scale and how we can control it. Small is different and that is visibly true in churches all around Europe as the coloring of the
                    glass is done by nanoparticles ground to different sizes. Hence the properties of things change when science is on that scale. Now when I started studying
                    Nanoscience my dream was to control atoms and construct from a bottom-up approach rather to top-down. This is far from reality just yet, at least on a large scale.
                    One of the core pillars in Nanoscience is the idea of being interdisciplinary. That is not to say other fields are not, but while a Chemist is really strong in
                    chemistry, I have skills within physics, chemistry, biology and molecularbiology. Therefore I can understand the terminology used to a high or some degree in all fields.
                    Furthermore due to the "Nano" focus, characterization of the nanoscale is of critical importance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An example of this focus is seen here on these images. Image 3 shows an Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), which has been used to make the AFM images seen on this
                    page. On image 1 and 2 an AFM images of a CD and DVD can be seen respectively.  Notice the small black marks on the images. These are where the storaging occurs and the reason why a DVD is a
                    better storage device than a CD is due to smaller holes, hence a larger concentration. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even though these are antiquated nowadays and even were back when these images were taken,
                    then Nanoscience make the technology much easier to understand than just putting them in a PC to be read. Therefore Nanoscience gives, in general, a new perspective and insight into
                    another world namely the atomic scale. Therefore it is necessary to work with a combination between theory and practice in the form of characterization, and it is this strength that also makes it
                    a very promising scientific field now and in the future.

                <div class="h2Box"><h2>What can I, as a Nanoscientist, contribute with?</h2></div>
                <p>
                    Since Nanoscience is an interdisciplinary field, then I can be sort of a translator between different fields of natural sciences. Not only that I can draw inspiration
                    from the other fields and find solutions. For example in the field of implants the understanding of biology and biocompatibility is of critical importance, which I got
                    some knowledge about. Another example could be corrosion, since it is an interplay between physics and chemistry. Understanding electrochemistry on a simple level and
                    applying concepts of Electrodynamics and Surface Physics to this field makes for an interesting way of thinking about corrosion. In other words it is possible to combine
                    the best of both worlds and understanding how a concept in chemistry and translate it to phyiscs and their terms. Even though this could seem like a lack of specialization,
                    it is not the case and in my case I have focused on materials science ranging from the inorganic materials found in our bodies to the theory of metals and their properties.
                    That is the true strength of Nanoscience, namely the capability to take on most subjects without having to start from scratch and have the knowledge on how to get things
                    started.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In short I, as a Nanoscientist, can contribute with:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Materials Science ranging from Biomaterials and Polymers to the theory of Metallic properties.</li>
                        <li>A broad knowledge foundation in most natural sciences with the ability to understand the different termonologies.</li>
                        <li>A solid mathematical toolkit combined with the physical understanding of the world from physics.</li>
                        <li>Data science, spotting trends and number crunching in front of a computer.</li>
                        <li>Mathematical modelling with inspiration from other fields and a creative mind that can think out of the box.</li>

                        <li>Characterization Techniques and quality assurance.</li>

                    Characterization is of utmost importance to Nanoscience as mentioned earlier. Therefore a great deal of effort goes into understanding how different microscopy techniques work
                    and how to analyze the images that are obtained when using these. Furthermore it is even more important in the case, where one is working on the atomic level to visualize the
                    effects done by the technique chosen. By this I mean for example if a Nanoscientist attempts to get a nanoscale coating, then it is important to actually see the outcome in
                    order to understand the macroscopic effects observed. Nanoscience uses microscopy techniques such as SPM (Scanning Probe Microscopy), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and
                    Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) to see on the nanometer level. I personally have used AFM, which is of type SPM, and I have training in using SEM. One of these can
                    be seen in the introduction in images 1 through 3. Anothe example is were I used lithography in order to make an anti-structure of a master pattern. The way this was done
                    was by using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), which was put into the master pattern and cured (heated), which hardens the polymer. Hence it could be taken of the mask and characterized.
                    This was done both by AFM and SEM and serves as a great example for comparing these. Images 4 and 5 were taken using AFM and images 7 and 8 by SEM. Note that the size of the scale on
                    SEM is much smaller, hence it is possible to observe the pattern in much great detail. The white protrusions seen clearly on image 8 creates the anti-pattern observed on image 7.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are a bunch of other techniques readily available to a Nanoscientist, and it is important to mention that I have knowledge of characterization technqiues from
                    chemistry, physics and (molecular)biology. Therefore I can easily adapt to any given situation and learn the core concepts and how a machine work within a short span of time.
                    An example of a technique can be seen in image 6, where polystyrene balls have been used to create a metal pattern on a silicium surface. This was done by depositing the metal
                    by evaporating it onto the surface. This was followed by washing the polystyrene balls off, which leaves this beautiful pattern. The image was taken using SEM.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To summarize the versatility of Nanoscience and the knowledge obtained throughout the study of Nanoscience gives so many tools and options for future development and it gives both
                    a new perspective and an open mind to other solutions than found in a single field of natural science due to its heavy focus on interdisciplinarity.
