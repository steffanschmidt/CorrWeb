                <p>
                    Materials science is the area I specialized in and have a broad knowledge about. This ranges from biological environment with biomaterials and the
                    chemistry of life to the derivation and understanding of the equations governing materials and their properties. Other than my theoretical understanding I also have knowledge in <em>Statistics</em>.
                    Other than this I have had a some <a href="nanoscience.html">Nanoscience</a> courses, which due to its interdisciplinary nature can be in either of the fields discussed below.  In most cases this was 
                    focused around research in catalysis, graphene doping or work in biomedical application. You can read more about the research conducted and the aread that is specialized in at 
                    <a href="http://inano.au.dk/research/research-areas/" target="_blank">iNano</a> at Aarhus University. However despite the fact I have not worked with all of these topics during my studies, then
                    I have the knowledge in other to work within these fields. <br />
                    In any case you can see short list of the most important subjects from my perspective below:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Surface and Bulk properties, Coatings and characterization thereof.</li>
                    <li>Solid state physics and the properties and theory of metals.</li>
                    <li>Electric and magnetic fields, thermodynamics and mechanics.</li>
                    <li>Inorganic chemistry - synthesizing new materials.</li>
                    <li>Polymers and Soft Materials in general - synthesis and characterization</li>
                    <li>Bioinorganic materials, Biomaterials and Biochemistry.</li>
                    <li>Nanocharacterization.</li>
                    <li>Statistics.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Some of these subjects will be covered below, however within all of these fields I have had the basic courses, which has given me the solid knowledge foundation I have. Hence if you have any questions
                    regarding some specific field i.e. if I have knowledge in some area, then feel free to contact me. 
                    Through my studies I have worked the most with synthesis and characterization of inorganic materials as can be seen in<a href="chemistry.html">Chemistry</a>. However other than that I have quite a lot
                    of experience with materials in practice, since I have worked with <a href="practical.html#designProduction">Prototype Development</a> and production of these. An example of this is making molds for
                    <a href="chemistry.html#ceramicsMolds">Ceramic Components</a> <em>High Pressure Synthesis</em>. Therefore I am used to thinking in materials and their properties in order to select them for practical
                    applications.

                <p>
                    Materials chemistry is the field I have worked the most in as stated above. My main focus in my research was <a href="highPressure">High Pressure Synthesis</a> and in general solid state
                    synthesis. The basis for this is simply to mix powders and let them react by heating. However things get more complicated in practice, since usually there are requirements to the surrondings
                    and there exists a broad range of methods for controlling these. In short you end up with a powder or crystal which can be characterized with different techniques. The most common is definitely PXRD,
                    since it allows for characterization of ones powder. There are also wet chemistry and sol gel chemistry which ultimately lead to a powder product, but a through a very different reaction pathway with
                    its own advantages and disadvantages. All of this can be found in the tab <em>"Chemistry"</em>.
                    Other than my experimental work I have also had a broad range of courses in chemistry, which helps me understand the properties that can be observed. The most important courses I have had in chemistry are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Inorganic Chemistry.</li>
                        <li>Experimental Materials Chemistry.</li>
                        <li>Organic Chemistry.</li>
                        <li>Soft Condensed Matter.</li>
                        <li>Polymer Chemistry.</li>
                        <li>Crystallopgraphy.</li>
                    </ul>
                    The theories used in chemistries are obviously not the same, since their focuses are very different. However in many cases there is a overlap, since for example <em>Heat Capacity</em> requires an 
                    understanding of physics to decipher the results obtained in experiment.

                <p>
                    Throughout my studies of Nanoscience I have had a lot of courses in physics. The basics such as <em>Mechanics</em>, <em>Thermodynamics</em> and <em>Waves and Optics</em> are of course in my skillset.
                    However these are elementary, and I took courses within more advanced topics in physics. These gave me a really solid knowledge in physics with a lot of courses with heavy focus on theory with some 
                    of these having an experimental part as well. There are two course I would like to emphasize namely <em>Solid State Physics</em> and <em>Electrodynamics</em>. In the former there are two. One being
                    elementary whereas the second advanced. Nevertheless in both cases these have a heavy focus on theory and has given me a broad range of mathematical tools, how to describe these properties and finally
                    how to interpret the values found to their physical properties. This is of course only oversimplified, but these have been very useful to me due to the skills I obtained. <br />
                    Neverthless the most important courses I have had in this area are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Solid State Physics.</li>
                        <li>Surface Physics.</li>
                        <li>Electrodyanimcs.</li>
                        <li>Computational Phyiscs.</li>
                        <li>Semiconductors.</li>
                        <li>Quantum Mechanics.</li>

                <p>
                    The building block of life are based on inorganic materials combined with organic matter. Therefore usually it is a composite where the building blocks are inorganic in nature
                    but are reinforced with biological compounds such as proteins in other to obtain a greater strength. Apart from that I have a broad range of general biological courses 
                    (e.g. biology, biochemistry, molecular biology), which provides a great general knowledge that helps me understand the processes in biological environment and the mechanisms
                    that maintain the biological systems in question. Hence despite it being the area I have had the least courses in, I have a solid foundation for learning and developing within
                    this field. <br />
                    The most important courses are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bioiorganic Materials.</li>

                        <li>Biomaterials.</li>

                        <figcaption>
                            Crude corrosion setup I used at Terma. I used the equipment I had available to me at the time, and I have since improved and compacted this setup quite a bit
                            with what I learned about electronics.
                        </figcaption>

                <p>
                    Parallel to my studies I worked once a week at Terma, where I was responsible for developing predicting lifetimes for objects under galvanic corrosion and screening materials for 
                    their corrosion resistance. This was attempted by developing a mathematical model, which described the material and external parameters in generalized terms in order to be able to
                    be independent of the location, since Terma has equipment in many parts of the world. Furthermore one more advantage is that the corrosion experiments would not take long, where 
                    standard experiments such as <em>Highly Accelerated Corrosion Tests (HACT)</em> are quite time consuming. The ambition was to be able to screen a material within half day. However
                    one major drawback was that much of the work had to be done from the bottom up, hence due to my limited time I was not able to finish the research. The research I did was based
                    on my experience and theoretical knowledge from chemistry and physics. Especially my knowledge of electrodynamic and mass transport and reaction knowledge from chemistry helped
                    me in this endeavour.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following Terma I have been working on improving the work I started. Mostly in the experimental setup since I did not have any equipment available to me. Therefore I had to develop a
                    small compact setup, which could do what I needed with a high precision. The first <a href="practical.html#electronics">Corrosion Setup</a> I made can be seen here. I am currently using
                    this along with one similar to conduct eight experiments concurrently. Nevertheless due to the limitations with this I have been working on improving this, which also can be found in 
                    <a href="practical.html">Practical</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since my main barrier to overcome has been within my experimental setup after Terma much of the theoretical work has been on standby. However with the experimental setups getting "close" to
                    being done, then I will soon turn my attention towards theoretical and software development in order to simulate corrosion spreading based on the parameters I used at Terma.
