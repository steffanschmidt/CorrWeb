                    First of all let me thank you for taking the time to visit my website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The purpose of this site is to give you a more in-depth knowledge on my competencies.
                    It is intended to supplement my resume and application due to the limited amount of space on these and allow me to share who I am and what I can contribute with in greater detail.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can either learn about me by browsing this site or play the small mini-game in <a href="Tabs/game.html">Game</a>.
                    This is intended to provide you with information in a fun and interactive way by allowing you to explore and select your topic(s) of interest.
                </p>
                <p>If you have questions feel free to contact me on either phone, email or LinkedIn found at the bottom of each page.</p>

                    Note: This site is under development and by no means done. Therefore expect changes and even though I attempt to at least have the core content in place, I cannot guarantee
                    some things may be removed or missing entirely.

                    Update 28/03/2018: The game is under development, but the player can be controlled and jump.
                    Nanoscience, Practical and Programming are almost done, but still needs some polishing and proof-reading.

                <p>
                    This site contains an animated background. However due to the fact it is meant as an informal site, then as fun as it might be to code and watch for the first two minutes,
                    then it is possible to turn them on/off using these buttons. This will be saved for the other topics found on this site for as long as you have this site opened i.e.
                    it will forget your setting if close this window in your browser. The background animation is turned on per default.
                </p>
