                    First of all let me thank you for taking the time to visit my website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The purpose of this site is to give you a more in-depth knowledge on my competencies.
                    It is intended to supplement my resume and application due to the limited amount of space on these and allow me to share who I am and what I can contribute with in greater detail.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can either learn about me by browsing this site or play the small mini-game in <a href="Tabs/game.html">Game</a>.
                    This is intended to provide you with information in a fun and interactive way by allowing you to explore and select your topic(s) of interest.
                </p>
                <p>If you have questions feel free to contact me on either phone, email or LinkedIn found at the bottom of each page.</p>
